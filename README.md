# Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between two or more groups. It is a powerful tool that can be used to make informed decisions about everything from medical research to marketing campaigns.<br/><br/>
However, it is important to understand the potential pitfalls of hypothesis testing, such as outliers, type I and type II errors, and p-hacking, in order to avoid making false conclusions.

  <li><b>Outliers</b> are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data.</li>
<li><b>Type I errors </b>occur when we reject a true null hypothesis.</li>
<li><b>Type II errors </b>occur when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis.</li>
<li><b>P-hacking</b> is the practice of manipulating data to produce statistically significant results.</li>
</ul>
It is important to be aware of these potential pitfalls and to take steps to avoid them when performing hypothesis testing. For example, you can identify and handle outliers before performing statistical analysis, choose appropriate alpha and beta levels, be transparent about your data analysis and statistical methods, and avoid selectively reporting results.
<h3> How outliers can affect our data</h3>
Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as human error, data corruption, or natural variation.Outliers can have a significant impact on the results of statistical analysis. For example, a single outlier can cause the mean, median, and standard deviation of a dataset to be skewed. This can lead to false conclusions being drawn from the data.
<h3>Type I and Type II errors</h3>
Type I and type II errors are two types of errors that can occur when performing hypothesis testing.<br/><br/>
<b>Type I error:</b> This is the error of rejecting a true null hypothesis.<br/>For example, if you are a patient with a headache and the doctor says that you have a brain tumor, when you actually do not.<br/></br>
<b>Type II error:</b> This is the error of failing to reject a false null hypothesis.</br>For example, if you are a patient with a brain tumor and the doctor says that you have a headache, when you actually have a brain tumor.
<h3>P-hacking</h3> 
P-hacking is the practice of manipulating data to produce statistically significant results. This can be done by selecting particular data that aligns with one's goal or by discarding data that does not support one's hypothesis.<br/><br/>
P-hacking is a serious problem in scientific research. It can lead to false conclusions being drawn from the data and can undermine the credibility of scientific findings.

# Conclusion
It is important to be aware of the potential for bias in hypothesis testing. When interpreting the results of a hypothesis test, it is important to consider the following:

1. The study design: Was the study well-designed and unbiased?
2. The data: Was all of the relevant data included in the analysis?
3. The p-value: Is the p-value less than 0.05?
4. The effect size: Is the difference between the two groups large enough to be meaningful?

If you are unsure about the results of a hypothesis test, it is always best to consult with a statistician.
